TITLE :
Network File Sharing Server And Client

INTRODUCTION:

File sharing over a network is a crucial feature in modern computing environments. This project implements a networked file-sharing system using C++, enabling secure communication between clients and a server.
The server maintains a shared directory of files. Clients can:

a)Authenticate with username/password

b)List files on the server

c)Download files

d)Upload files

e)Communication is secured and ensuring confidentiality and integrity of transferred data.

OBJECTIVE :

The main objectives of this project are:

a)Establish socket communication between server and client using C++

b)Enable clients to list files available on the server

c)Enable file transfer from server to client

d)Enable file upload from client to server

e)Implement security features such as authentication and TLS encryption
